## Introduction

 Currently there is no effective system to manage undergraduate studentsâ€™ marks either it is handled manually or in spreadsheets. Therefore the aim of our project is to build a mobile application to automate the student grades management system process. Compared to the manual system this will save lots of time and also makes your work easier.
